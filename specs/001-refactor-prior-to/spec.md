## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: How should the transition from monolithic GalaxyCanvas to the new modular system happen? ‚Üí A: Side-by-Side Migration - New and old code coexist, gradually migrate features one manager at a time
- Q: Which manager should be extracted and implemented first to establish the foundation for subsequent migrations? ‚Üí A: GalaxyStateManager - Central state management enables other managers to coordinate
- Q: During the Side-by-Side Migration, if a newly migrated manager causes critical issues in production, what is the rollback approach? ‚Üí A: Handle manually as needed

## Performance & Accessibility Considerations

### Performance Impact
- [x] Feature impact on 60fps target assessed - **CRITICAL: MUST NOT regress performance**
- [x] Memory budget impact estimated (< 500MB total) - **MUST maintain or improve current usage**
- [x] Asset loading size estimated - **No change to asset loading**
- [x] Render performance considerations documented - **Animation loop optimization required**

### Accessibility Requirements
- [x] Keyboard navigation requirements defined - **No changes to existing accessibility**
- [x] Screen reader announcements specified - **Maintain current screen reader support**
- [x] Focus management requirements documented - **No changes to focus management**
- [x] Color contrast requirements noted (4.5:1 minimum) - **No UI visual changes**
- [x] Reduced motion alternatives specified - **Maintain existing motion preferences**

**Note**: This refactoring focuses on internal architecture. All existing accessibility features MUST be preserved without regression.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **developer maintaining the galaxy visualization system**, I need a **modular, testable architecture** so that I can **add new features (like locations) without breaking existing functionality or creating maintenance nightmares**.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the current monolithic GalaxyCanvas component, **When** I need to add a new feature, **Then** I should be able to modify a single, focused module without touching unrelated code

2. **Given** a bug in camera animation, **When** I need to debug the issue, **Then** I should be able to isolate the camera animation system independently of scene rendering

3. **Given** the refactored architecture, **When** I run the application, **Then** all existing features MUST work identically with no visual or functional regressions

4. **Given** resource cleanup concerns, **When** the component unmounts, **Then** all Three.js resources MUST be properly disposed without memory leaks

5. **Given** state management complexity, **When** state changes occur, **Then** all dependent systems MUST update consistently and predictably

6. **Given** the refactored animation system, **When** the animation loop runs, **Then** frame rate MUST maintain 60fps with no performance degradation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when **multiple managers try to update state simultaneously**? (State manager must handle concurrent updates safely)
- How does the system handle **resource initialization failures**? (Graceful degradation with error reporting)
- What happens when **disposing resources during active animations**? (Cleanup must be safe during any lifecycle state)
- How does the system handle **React strict mode double-mounting in development**? (Managers must be idempotent)
- What happens when **switching between fixed and free interaction modes**? (Mode transitions must be seamless without state corruption)
- What happens when **newly migrated manager causes production issues**? (Manual rollback handling - no formal automated rollback strategy required)
