## Dependencies

### Critical Path
- Tests (T006-T015) MUST complete and FAIL before implementation (T016-T027)
- Types (T016-T019) before components (T020-T024)
- Core components (T020-T024) before integration (T025-T027)
- Component integration (T028-T031) before asset management (T032-T035)
- All implementation before performance optimization (T036-T039)
- Everything before polish phase (T040-T052)

### File Dependencies
- T016 blocks T020, T024 (same file dependencies)
- T025 blocks T026, T027 (galaxy system integration order)
- T028 blocks T029 (layout integration after component replacement)
- T030 blocks T036, T038 (WebGL sharing before performance optimization)

## Validation Checklist

Before marking complete, verify:
- [ ] All contract tests exist and initially fail
- [ ] LoadingScreen component integrates seamlessly with existing GalaxyCanvas
- [ ] Particle system sharing maintains 32,768 particle count consistency
- [ ] Animation completes within 3-5 seconds (NFR-002)
- [ ] 60fps performance maintained during particle effects (NFR-001)
- [ ] WebGL failure gracefully redirects to main interface (FR-012)
- [ ] Dark glassmorphism theme applied consistently (DSR-001 to DSR-004)
- [ ] Audio preferences respected throughout experience (FR-008)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design implemented (NFR-004)

## Notes
- **[P] tasks**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **TDD Critical**: Tests must be written first and must fail before implementation
- **Performance Focus**: All tasks must maintain 60fps and constitutional compliance
- **Integration Priority**: Seamless handoff between loading and galaxy systems is critical
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Every task must preserve SPA architecture and deployment flexibility

Total Tasks: 52 | Parallel Opportunities: 23 | Critical Path Length: ~15 tasks
